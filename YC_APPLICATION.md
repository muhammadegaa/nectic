# YC Application Draft — Nectic

**Batch target:** W26 / S26  
**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, specific, no marketing speak. First sentence = critical info.  
**Research:** `RESEARCH_YC_2026.md`

---

## 1. What is your company going to make?

Finance teams spend 5+ hours a week recreating reports and transferring data between systems. Nectic lets them ask the question—"What's our burn rate?" "How much did we spend on software?"—and get the answer in 30 seconds. Connect your data (Excel, CSV, or database). No SQL, no BI setup.

## 2. What is your company going to make? (one sentence)

Finance teams spend 5+ hours/week on reports. We let them ask the question and get the answer in 30 seconds.

---

## 3. Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you worked on together.

[Fill: Specific project with measurable outcome. Example format: "We built X in Y days; it did Z."]

---

## 4. Please tell us in one or two sentences about something impressive that each founder has built or achieved.

[Founder 1]: [Specific, measurable. Not generic. E.g. "Shipped X used by Y users" or "Built Z that did W."]  
[Founder 2]: [Same format.]

---

## 5. Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

[Fill: Real story. Creativity, initiative, beating the system. Not software. Be specific.]

---

## 6. How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time?

[Fill: Honest numbers. E.g. "3 months; 2 months full-time."]

---

## 7. How many active users or customers do you have? If your product is used by other companies, how many companies use it?

[Fill: Demo tries: X. Beta signups: Y. Paying/LOI: Z. Be honest—YC funds pre-revenue.]

---

## 8. Anything else you would like us to know?

**Why now:** LLMs can reliably query structured data. YC RFS Spring 2026: "Cursor for PM" — same pattern. Finance = operational discovery. 42% of FP&A time is spent gathering data; we eliminate that.

**Wedge:** Spend questions first. Burn rate, top expenses, category breakdown. 82% use 4+ systems; 69% spend 5+ hrs/week on reports (insightsoftware). We're not replacing BI—we're replacing the ad hoc report request.

**Obstacle we've thought about:** NL2SQL failed because of semantic ambiguity. We narrow: one vertical (finance), one question type first (spend). SMB finance teams (50–200 emp)—faster decisions, same pain.

## 9. Please tell us about your idea and your team (video script — 60 seconds)

| Segment | Duration | Script |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Intro | 10s | "We're [names]. We built Nectic." |
| Problem | 15s | "FP&A spends 42% of their time gathering data. 69% spend 5+ hours a week recreating reports. 89% make decisions on bad data." |
| Solution | 20s | "We let them ask the question—'What's our burn rate?' 'How much did we spend on software?'—and get the answer in 30 seconds. No SQL, no dashboards." |
| Progress | 10s | "[X demo tries / Y signups]. Try it at [URL]." |
| Close | 5s | "We're validating. Building Excel upload next. Applying to move fast." |

## 10. Competitors

| Competitor | What they do | Our edge |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Meridian | Agentic financial modeling; deterministic; Excel/Sheets | We do ad hoc answers, not modeling |
| Jinba (YC W26) | Chat-to-workflow; 40k users | We do data answers, not workflow creation |
| ThoughtSpot, Metabase | BI dashboards; setup, SQL | Chat-first; no setup for spend questions |
| ChatExcel | Upload Excel, ask questions; 3.2M users | We wedge finance/FP&A; spend questions first |

---

## 11. Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area?

[Fill: Personal connection to the problem. E.g. "We've seen finance teams wait 3 days for a spend report. We built internal tools; this is the productized version."]

---

## 12. What's new or different about what you're making?

Narrow wedge: spend questions first. "How much did we spend?" "What's our burn rate?" FP&A spends 42% gathering data—we eliminate that. NL2SQL failed on semantic ambiguity; we solve it by narrowing to one vertical and one question type.
